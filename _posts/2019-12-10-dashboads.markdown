#### Problem
This project began because customers and prospects asked for it by name. "Do you have dashboards?" was a common question on calls. Defining the problem really was an exercise in what customers meant by "a dashboard" and how they anticipated using it.

What we learned was while OpenGov’s reporting product had powerful data exploration capabilities, it didn't meet managers' need for a quick snapshot of "How are we doing?" An aggregate view of a municipality’s finances and performance measures was clearly needed.

### Research Insights

Governments need to monitor to stay accountable.

The full picture is often in pieces in different reports in OpenGov and leadership doesn't have time to poke around.

Users need to quickly get into why something is off.

This allowed us to test out different paradigms for how to solve this.

Through feedback, we were able to zero in on the required data, information architecture, and visual design for the tiles.

### Design
Because of the scale of this product we needed to systematize and standardize the tile components.
